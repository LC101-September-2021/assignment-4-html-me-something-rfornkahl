        Famous artist Vincent Van Gogh once said "If you don't have a dog - at least one - there isn't necessarily anything wrong with you, but there may be something wrong with your life."

            <h3 class="dog_name">Yogi</h3>
            <p class="body">The first dog that me and wife adopted as a married couple was Yogi. Yogi is to best of our knowledge a Schnoozer and Yorki mix. We first met Yogi 5 years ago at the St. Louis Humane's Society.  At the time Yogi was a very hyper dog who went by the name of Stewart.  Yogi would bark constantly and paw at anyone who came near him.
                Over the years Yogi has calmed down, so some degree, but has always maintained a vocal party of our family.  As soon as someone walks by our home he is ready to dart to the window and 
                let them know he is home.  </p>

            <h3 class="dog_name">Stan </h3>
                        <p class="body">Stan is the newest addition to our family.  Stan is to the best of our knowledge a Shitzu and Yorki mix. We've had Stan for 2 years come Thanksgiving. When we initially adopted Stan, we were told by the shelter that he was found on the side of a road. As time has went on
                with Stan, we've come to find out that this might not have been a fluke.  Stan is a runner, he is always looks for his next great escape.
            he will come.   </p>
